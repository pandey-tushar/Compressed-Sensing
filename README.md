# Compressed-Sensing
This repository will be focussed on some codes for deterministic construction of compressed sensing matrices and possibly some random matrices for comparison.
The first code is the construction of DeVore's matrix using finite fields. There exists a better (circulant) version of this matrix but I still need to figure that out in an optimal way.
